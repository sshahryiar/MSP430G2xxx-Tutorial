 *  ======== PORT1 Interrupt Service Routine ========
 *
 * Here are several important notes on using PORTx interrupt Handler:
 *
 * 1. User must explicitly clear the port interrupt flag before exiting
 *
 *    PxIFG &= ~(BITy);
 *
 * 2. User could also exit from low power mode and continue with main
 *    program execution by using the following instruction before exiting
 *    this interrupt handler.
 *
 *    __bic_SR_register_on_exit(LPMx_bits);
